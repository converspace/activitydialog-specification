Since this URI is on the users website, it will authenticate the user and the action therefore will happen on the users site and send an [Activity Pingback](http://activitypingback.org/) to the thrid-party website about it. This is kinda like a bookmarklet to a URI on your website that is automatically invoked by a third-party website.\r\n\r\nThis could also be implemented as a bookmarklet that parses a microformats on the resource it is invoked on and presents all possible actions allowed on that resource.","google":""}
